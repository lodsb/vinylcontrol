#X text 392 35 vinylcontrol~ accepts two (optional) parameters: 1)
vinyl-type (serato_2a \, serato_2b \, serato_cd \, traktor_a \, traktor_b)
2) smoothing: used to average pitch-values and the alive bang since
the event generation is taking place on dsp-level The 3 outlets provide:
1) alive - bang is sent when the decoding starts/stops (ie. input is
above a certain threshold and timecode is being tracked) 2) pitch -
float that is 1 at 33 rpm in forward direction \; negative values indicate
backward-movement 3) relative position \; the start is the first cue-point
(first tracked timecode where the needle was dropped) and can be reset
to the current timecode-position by sending a band to the third inlet.
the end position is the last sane timecode on the record. the position
is calculated using (current_position-start_position)/(last_position-start_position)
\, thus giving a range between 0 and 1 between the end position and
the relative start position and negative values for positions before
the start position. The 3 inlets are: 1) left input 2) right input
(take care of the cabling from your turntable) 3) reset for the relative
start position The timecoder is used from xwax (http://www.xwax.co.uk)
